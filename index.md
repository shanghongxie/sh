	I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Statistics at the <a href = "https://e.swufe.edu.cn/"> Southwestern University of Finance and Economics</a>. I  completed my Ph.D. and postdoctoral training in the <a href = "https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics"> Department of Biostatistics</a> at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health, working with Professors 
		<a href = "https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/yw2016/"> Yuanjia Wang</a> and <a href = "https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/to166"> R. Todd Ogden</a>.  <br/><br/>
		My current research focuses on developing graphical models and network analysis methods to learn the structure of static and dynamic biomarker networks. I am also interested in treatment strategies, estimating individualized treatment rules that are tailored according to subject-specific features, and functional data analysis.
