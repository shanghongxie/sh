	I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Statistics at the <a href = "https://e.swufe.edu.cn/"> Southwestern University of Finance and Economics</a>. I received my Ph.D. in <a href = "https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics"> Biostatistics</a> from <a href = "https://www.columbia.edu/"> Columbia University</a> in 2019 and was a postdoctoral research scientist at <a href = "https://www.columbia.edu/"> Columbia University</a> from 2019 to 2021. <br/><br/>
        My research interests lie in the broad area of machine learning, network analysis, precision medicine, functional data analysis, causal inference, mediation analysis with genetic and neuroimaging biomarkers, and variable selection, with applications to medical and public health fields.

## Research Interests
Machine learning; network analysis; graphical model; precision medicine; functional data analysis; causal inference; neuroimaging; biomarker; neurological and psychiatric diseases; mental health <br/><br/>

 Currently, my work primarily focuses on learning static and dynamic biomarker networks (e.g., brain networks, disease symptom networks, omics networks). The aim is to take a systemic view of multiple biomarkers to investigate the etiology and progression of diseases, develop novel features for early disease detection, and conduct integrative data  analysis. <br/><br/>
	I am also interested in precision medicine and functional data, where I estimate individualized treatment rules that are tailored based on subject-specific features and integrate functional data analysis with machine learning techniques.
