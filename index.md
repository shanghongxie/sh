<img align="right" src="assets/img/bio-photo.jpg" width="220" height="275"> I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the Department of Biostatistics at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health under the supervision of Professors [R. Todd Ogden](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/to166) and [Yuanjia Wang](https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/yw2016/). I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from Columbia University in 2019, advised by Professor Yuanjia Wang.

My methodological research interests lie in the broad area of machine learning, network analysis, precision medicine, functional data analysis, mediation analysis with genetic and neuroimaging biomarkers, causal inference, and variable selection. 

My collaborative research experiences include clinical trial designs and performing a variety of statistical analysis with clinicians and collaborators in the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI), Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, and School of Social Work at Columbia University. I also have collaborated with neuroimaging researchers at the University College London Institute of Neurology.
