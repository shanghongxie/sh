Todd Ogden](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/to166). I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from Columbia University in 2019.


My methodological research interests lie in the broad area of machine learning, network analysis, precision medicine, functional data analysis, mediation analysis with genetic and neuroimaging biomarkers, causal inference, and variable selection, with applications to medical and public health fields.
