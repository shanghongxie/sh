	I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Statistics at the <a href = "https://e.swufe.edu.cn/"> Southwestern University of Finance and Economics</a>. I received my Ph.D. in <a href = "https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics"> Biostatistics</a> from <a href = "https://www.columbia.edu/"> Columbia University</a> in 2019 and was a postdoctoral research scientist at <a href = "https://www.columbia.edu/"> Columbia University</a> from 2019 to 2021. <br/><br/>
        My methodological research interests lie in the broad area of machine learning, network analysis, precision medicine, functional data analysis, causal inference, mediation analysis with genetic and neuroimaging biomarkers, and variable selection, with applications to medical and public health fields. My collaborative research experiences include clinical trial designs and performing a variety of statistical analyses such as meta-analysis, longitudinal analysis, and also neuroimaging studies.
