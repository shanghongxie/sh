	I am an Assistant Professor in the  <a href = "https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/statistics/"> Department of Statistics</a> at the <a href = "https://sc.edu/"> University of South Carolina</a>. I earned  my Ph.D. in <a href = "https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics"> Biostatistics</a> from <a href = "https://www.columbia.edu/"> Columbia University</a> in 2019. <br/><br/>
        My research interests lie in the broad area of machine learning, network analysis, precision medicine, functional data analysis, causal inference, mediation analysis with neuroimaging and genetic biomarkers, and variable selection. My work focuses on developing machine learning and generative models to address complex challenges in neuroscience, medicine, and public health. <br/><br/>

## Research Interests
Machine learning; network analysis; graphical model; precision medicine; functional data analysis; causal inference; neuroimaging (e.g., sMRI, DTI, fMRI, EEG); biomarker; neurological and psychiatric diseases; mental health <br/><br/>

## Functional and Complex Data Analysis (FUNCODA) Working Group
Co-founded with <a href = "https://wuyx5.github.io/"> Yuexuan Wu</a>, <a href = "https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/statistics/our_people/directory/consagra_william.php"> William Consagra </a>

Biweekly meetings featuring a mix of presentations, paper discussions, and invited talks.

Open to faculty members and graduate students interested in functional data (e.g., curves, surfaces) and complex data (e.g., high-dimensional data, graphs, tensors), with applications across various domains such as neuroimaging, medicine, public health, and environmental science.

More coming in Spring 2025.
